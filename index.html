                <p>Everyone says "talk to your customers." But first you need to <strong>find</strong> them.</p>
                <p>That means 10+ hours scrolling Reddit, Twitter, forums, and communities — hoping to stumble across the right threads. Most founders skip this and wonder why no one's buying.</p>
