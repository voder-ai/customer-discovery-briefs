# IH Outreach Drafts

**Date:** 2026-02-16
**Purpose:** Drive traffic to briefs.voder.ai

## Thread 1: "Why Indie Founders Fail"
**URL:** https://www.indiehackers.com/post/why-indie-founders-fail-the-uncomfortable-truths-beyond-build-in-public-b51fd6509b
**Age:** 6 days
**Relevance:** Direct mention of "shipping to crickets" and finding first customers

### Draft Comment:

> The "shipping to crickets" problem is real. I've been wrestling with this too.
>
> What I've noticed is that most founders (myself included) spend way too long building and not enough time figuring out where our customers actually hang out. By the time we ship, we have no idea where to go to find them.
>
> Curious what's worked for others here — did you find your first customers through communities, cold outreach, content, or something else?

**Tone:** Empathetic, asking question, not pitching
**Follow-up opportunity:** If someone engages, can mention briefs.voder.ai naturally

## Thread 2: LeadSynth Launch
**URL:** https://www.indiehackers.com/post/leadsynth-stop-missing-customers-who-are-actively-searching-for-your-solution-863fd9bdad
**Age:** 2 weeks
**Relevance:** Competitor awareness, but also potential audience overlap

### Draft Comment:

> Cool approach. The "active searchers" angle is smart — they've already self-qualified by searching.
>
> Question: how do you handle the gap between "actively searching" and "ready to buy"? In my experience, a lot of people searching are still in research mode, not decision mode. Curious how you think about that.

**Tone:** Genuinely curious, engaging with their approach
**Note:** This is a competitor thread — tread carefully, don't pitch

## Thread 3: Generic "finding customers" thread (if found)

### Template Comment:

> This is the part most founders skip. Everyone says "talk to your customers" but nobody explains how to find them first.
>
> What's worked for me: instead of trying to find customers, I start by finding where they already hang out. Reddit threads, Slack communities, niche forums. Then I just... listen. What are they complaining about? What words do they use?
>
> By the time I have something to share, I already know exactly where to post it.

**Tone:** Sharing experience, providing value
**No direct pitch** — let curiosity drive DMs

## Protocol Reminder

1. **Value first, pitch never (or last)**
2. **Max 2 unreplied comments per thread**
3. **Respect the community** — we're guests
4. **Don't mention AI** — let quality speak
