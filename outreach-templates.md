## Cold DM (Reddit/IH)

> Hey [Name] — saw your post about [specific pain]. I've been working on a done-for-you customer intel service. Once a month, you get a brief showing exactly where your target customers hang out, what they're complaining about, and specific threads to engage. Not AI-generated fluff — actual verified threads with real URLs. Would a sample brief for [their niche] be useful?

## LinkedIn Connection

> Hey [Name] — noticed you're building [product]. I help indie founders figure out where their customers actually hang out online. Would love to connect and hear more about what you're working on.

---

## Warm Lead Follow-up

> Hey [Name] — just wanted to check in. Did the brief land okay? No pressure — if it wasn't useful, that's good feedback too.

## Thread Comment (Public Engagement)

> This is exactly the pain I've been solving. I put together customer intel briefs — where your ICP hangs out, what they're complaining about, specific threads to engage. If anyone wants a sample for their niche, DM me. Free for the first few.
